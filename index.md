## Yuqiao (Echo) Zhong

I am currently pursuing my master of business analytics degree from Simon Business School, University of Rochester - Class of 2020. I aspire to become a data analyst/marketing analyst/business analyst in the technology field to leverage and enhance my professional expertise to bring valuable insights based on data analytics.

### Introduction

This is a porfolio page where I applied what I learned in machine learning to some real life project. I am currently still at learning stage. Feel free to let me know if you have any critics or questions.

Kaggle | Udemy: Classify Yelp Reviews with Natural Language Processing using Python 

# My ultimate goal for this project is to predict whether a Yelp review is 1 star or 5 star based on the text content. I took a machine learning course taught by Jose Portilla on Udemy. And now I want to apply what I learned into a new project.

# First I vectorized text messages into a form that machine learning algorithms can understand. Next I train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between 1 star and 5 star messages. Finally, with the trained model, I will classify the reviews into 1 star or 5 star.

# Dataset Informatiom The yelp review dataset is obtained from Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013Each). Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review. The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users. The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.
