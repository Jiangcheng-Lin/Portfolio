# Yuqiao (Echo) Zhong

I am currently pursuing my master of business analytics degree from Simon Business School, University of Rochester - Class of 2020. I aspire to become a data analyst/marketing analyst/business analyst in the technology field to leverage and enhance my professional expertise to bring valuable insights based on data analytics.


## Introduction

This is a porfolio page where I applied what I learned in data analytics and machine learning to some real life projects. I am currently still at learning stage. Feel free to let me know if you have any critics or questions.

## Projects

### Kaggle | Udemy: Classify Yelp Reviews with Natural Language Processing using Python 

**[View Complete Project on Github](https://github.com/echozhong1202/profolio/blob/master/Classify%20Yelp%20Reviews%20into%201%20star%20and%205%20star%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20using%20Python.ipynb)**

> My ultimate goal for this project is to predict whether a Yelp review is 1 star or 5 star based on the text content. I took a machine learning course taught by Jose Portilla on Udemy. And now I want to apply what I learned into a new project.

> The yelp review dataset is obtained from Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013Each). Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. 

> The NLP process in this project is still at the basic level. This project is more about understanding NLP at a higher level.
